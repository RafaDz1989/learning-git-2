            <h2>First verse</h2>
            <p>We're not in love
                We share no stories
                Just something in your eyes
                Don't be afraid
                The shadows know me
                Let's leave the world behind</p>
            <h2>Second verse</h2>
            <p>Beneath the sky
                As black as diamonds
                We're running out of time
                Don't wait for truth
                To come and blind us
                Let's just believe their lies

                Believe it, I see it
                I know that you can feel it
                No secrets worth keeping
                So fool me like I'm dreaming</p>
            <h2>Chorus</h2>
            <p>Take me through the night
                Fall in to the darkside
                We don't need the light
                We'll live on the darkside
                I see it
                Let's feel it
                While we're still young and fearless
                Let go of the light
                Fall in to the darkside
                Fall in to the darkside
                Give in to the darkside
                Let go of the light
                Fall into the darkside</p>
