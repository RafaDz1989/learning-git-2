                <h2>First verse</h2>
                <p>We're not in love<br>
                We share no stories<br>
                Just something in your eyes<br>
                Don't be afraid<br>
                The shadows know me<br>
                Let's leave the world behind</p>
                <h2>Second verse</h2>
                <p>Beneath the sky<br>
                As black as diamonds<br>
                We're running out of time<br>
                Don't wait for truth<br>
                To come and blind us<br>
                Let's just believe their lies<br>

                Believe it, I see it<br>
                I know that you can feel it<br>
                No secrets worth keeping<br>
                So fool me like I'm dreaming</p>
                <h2>Chorus</h2>
                <p>Take me through the night<br>
                Fall in to the darkside<br>
                We don't need the light<br>
                We'll live on the darkside<br>
                I see it<br>
                Let's feel it<br>
                While we're still young and fearless<br>
                Let go of the light<br>
                Fall in to the darkside<br>
                Fall in to the darkside<br>
                Give in to the darkside<br>
                Let go of the light<br>
                Fall into the darkside</p>
